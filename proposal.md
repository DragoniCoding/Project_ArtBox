- I aim to create an Art Application that you can use to draw and then save the drawings to your computer from your browser

## Needs to Have

- canvas capabilities
    - you start by selecting the canvas size, then can alter it.
    - if you reduce the canvas to not include a drawing, drawing will be deleted and will not appear if extended again
- draw
    - draw on the canvas
- erase 
    - deletes the drawings that exist in the space of the curser
- the ability to save (simple screenshot of canvas)
    function in pf that saves the canvas, *saveCanvas()*
- different art tools
    - different things drawn depending on which radio option is selected
